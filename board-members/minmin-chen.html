          <p>
            MinMin Chen is a research scientist at Google Brain, currently
            studying reinforcement learning and sequence modeling. She has a
            passion for studying the way that artificial intelligence works with
            data, and has also developed a marketing model for Amazon. Chen will
            be helpful to our cause because she has prior experience with
            artificial intelligence, and creating a model for this will be much
            more manageable with her skills. Furthermore, she will help us
            spread information about our product with data and advertising
            modeling.

          <h1>Safety and Security</h1>
          <p>
            Our company understands that there are inherent risks in working
            with drones, and we strive to prioritize the safety of our
            customers, employees, and the general public in everything we do. We
            are constantly scrutinizing our technology to ensure accuracy and
            avoid bias in our products. We also focus heavily on the data
            security and safety of our customers, and we refuse to sell data to
            companies with detectable malicious intent. Finally, we will ensure
            that our technology is ethically sourced, and created in an
            environment that treats everyone fairly and equally.

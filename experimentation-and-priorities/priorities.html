          <h1>Priorities</h1>
          <h2>1. Accuracy</h2>
          <p>
            The highest priority experiment to test first is Experiment 1,
            focusing on the accuracy and efficiency of our computer vision
            translation technology. The success of our product hinges on its
            ability to accurately and efficiently translate sign language.
          </p>
          <h2>2. Accessibility and Affordability</h2>
          <p>
            The second priority experiment to test would be Experiment 3,
            focusing on the accessibility and affordability of our technology.
            It is essential to ensure that our product is user-friendly and
            financially accessible to a wide range of potential users. By
            refining our user interface and pricing model based on user
            feedback, we can create a product that effectively addresses the
            needs of our target market.
          </p>
          <h2>3. Effectiveness of Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations</h2>
          <p>
            The third priority experiment to test would be Experiment 2,
            focusing on the effectiveness of strategic partnerships and
            collaborations. This experiment will help us identify the most
            promising partnership opportunities and refine our approach to
            forming long-lasting, mutually beneficial collaborations.
